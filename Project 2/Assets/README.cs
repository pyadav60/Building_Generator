    /* Hi there! 
     * I made some tudor-ish townhomes.
     * 
     * SO this is definitely not my finest work.
     * I spent quite a bit of time trying to get the essential parts
     * of this project working (gable roofs in addition to the hip roofs, that also met
     * up and intersected cleanly). Window and door placement was also quite painful
     * and I wasn't able to get my logic to work as youll see when you change the seed.
     * 
     * These two issues ultimately cost me so much time, that I
     * simply had to move on or I'd miss the deadline entirely. There's a chance that I
     * work on it for another day and take the late penalty, but my other classwork is
     * piling on so I'm not certain.
     * 
     * Most of the other requirements are met, albeit a bit crudely. I apologize.
     * 
     * I hope whoever grades this is having a better time than me right now.
     * 
     * 
     *
