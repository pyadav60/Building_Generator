# Building Generator
Procedurally generates building meshes via script.
Footprint, roofing, height, windows, and doors are all randomized.
The buildings are all generally rudimentary in nature as this was a rather restrictive class assignment.
Still, you can view the different permutations by editing the random seed in the inspector.
